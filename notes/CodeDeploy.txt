AWS CodeDeploy
**************

Purpose: Deploy your build artifacts to runtime environments.

Deployment targets:

        1- EC2 instances (or Auto Scaling groups)

        2- Lambda functions

        3- ECS containers

Deployment types:

        1- In-place: Updates running instances directly.

        2- Blue/Green: Deploys new version to separate instances and switches traffic when healthy.

Key features:

        1- Tracks deployment status.

        2- Allows hooks for pre- and post-deployment actions (BeforeInstall, AfterInstall, ApplicationStart).

Example appspec.yaml:

    version: 0.0
    os: linux
    files:
    - source: /
        destination: /home/ec2-user/app
    hooks:
    BeforeInstall:
        - location: scripts/stop_app.sh
        timeout: 300
        runas: ec2-user
    AfterInstall:
        - location: scripts/install_dependencies.sh
        timeout: 300
        runas: ec2-user
    ApplicationStart:
        - location: scripts/start_app.sh
        timeout: 300
        runas: ec2-user
